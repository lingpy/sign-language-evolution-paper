This package contains the supplementary material needed to replicate the studies reported in
our study. For a list of all languages, see the file `languages.tsv`.

## Link to Database

To access the database directly online, in the EDICTOR too, just open the following link:

## Conversion to Nexus Format

The folder `data` provides instructions on converting the data to Nexus format.

## Phylogenetic analyses

The folders `matrices` and `networks` provide information on the phylogenetic analyses we carried out. The folder `analysis` provides the manual phylogenetic character mapping analysis.

## Detailed character analysis

The detailed character analysis discussed in the main text and the appendix can be found in the folder `analysis`, sheet `lists.xlsx`.
