# Supplementary Material «Evolutionary dynamics of sign language dispersal»

Original study:

> Power, Justin; Grimm, Guido; List, Johann-Mattis (2019): Evolutionary dynamics in the dispersal of sign languages. Unpublished manuscript, not peer-reviewed.

This package contains the supplementary material needed to replicate the studies reported in
our study. For a list of all languages, see the file `languages.tsv`.

## Link to Database

To access the database directly online, in the EDICTOR too, just open the following link:

```

The folder `data` contains a dump of the data in sqlite-format, and the folder `cldf` provides the data in cldf-format.

## Conversion to Nexus Format

The folder `data` provides instructions on converting the data to Nexus format.

## Phylogenetic analyses

The folders `matrix` and `networks` provide information on the phylogenetic analyses we carried out. The folder `analysis` provides the manual phylogenetic character mapping analysis.
